First request  UKOS
I used basic commands to solved exercises from szuflandia 
I am wrong absolute path with realative path.
I should remember that the abolute path (sciezka bezwgledna) always start with slash /
Ctrl+Alt+f4 is key combination for which i change graphic terminal to text terminal.

Second reguest UKOS
I was created directory tree to  experminet with chmod command,
after did this exercises i see progress in using linux.
In my opinon I should more pratice with chmod, beacuse somtimes I am getting lost with it.
Later I use echo and tail -f plik in two terminals two send message.
I log in to szuflandia and i created catalog public_html with file storna.html.
On my web I saw inscription "to jest moja strona domowa"
