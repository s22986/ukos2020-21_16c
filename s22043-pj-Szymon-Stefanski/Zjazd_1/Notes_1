Dear diary today I would like to tell you about
my first exercises from szuflandia UKOS 01 which I did.
I won't describe it in details - Mr. Tomasz said that
is ok to use general worlds when I write this note.

Those tasks was very easy - first part of tasks was
about position displaying, and I learn a lot about
basics functions and commands on terminal.

Second part of tasks was a little challenge for me
because I had to use the Internet and read a few
informations to complete - and I think that Internet
and english language is very usefull when you learn 
about computer science and you don't know how to
do something - you just can search this problem
on the Internet.

That's it for today. See you!!!
