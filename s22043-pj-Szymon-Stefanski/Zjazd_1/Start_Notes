My dear diary at the last lesson with Mr.Tomasz
I learned a lot of things about virtual machine,
Linux and Git. I'm very excited because I want to
learn more and more things about computers
and operation systems. I get some notes from
last lesson and I think I should remember
a lot of things but I'm ready to work hard
and make ready for next challenges.
That's it for today. See you for few weeks.
Bye!
