My dear diary, after few lecturers of UKOS I must remember to
NEVER delete files of other users - this repo wasn't my own
copy of repository where I can do what I want with other users
files, If I do this I make some problems to other people.

I should write something about last UKOS lecture but I write
most of main things in Tasks_2, I learned a lot of things about
processes and streams but I think I must learn more because
sometimes I just lost when I have few things to do and a lot of
command to write in terminal.

That's it for today. See you!!!
