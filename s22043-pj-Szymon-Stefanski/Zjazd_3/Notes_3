My dear diary

Today I learn a lot of thing about processes and streams.
The most interesting thing in those tasks was last
exercise with stoping GIMP process and running it in background
- I think that knowledge can be very useful when I have problem
with some programs or processes, because if I have this problem
without knowledge about that I probably go and restart all system.
