My dear diary

Today I get some knowledge about Linux, licenses and text editors.
The most important thing about this knowledge which I must remember
is that - I should be careful when I use some software because in the
licenses of this software can be written that after using this software
my work what I do goes into the public property!

Note about text editors - text editors aren't new to me, I use before
Geany when I started my adventure with programming, I used it to
programming in Python.
