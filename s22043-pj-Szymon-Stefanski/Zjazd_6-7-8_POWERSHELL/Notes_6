My dear diary

Today I learn something about Windows and Powershell.

Powershell is a command's interpreter which is available
in Windows XP or newer and it was made in 2006.

First of all we need to configurate Powershell in our computers
we have to run Powershell as adminnistrator and use command:

Set-ExecutionPlicy Bypass

If we do it we can run Powershell as normal user.

List of commands good to know at start:

If we need to see commands:
Get-Help Get-ExecutionPolicy

And if we need to see examples of them:
Get-Help Get-ExecutionPolicy -Examples

If we want to see list of available modules in Powershell:
Get-Module -ListAvailable

When I use "TAB" key I see available commands.
When I use "CTRL+SPACE" keys I see a list of proposed command
endings.

Sign "|" (pipeline), which runs the next command on the output from the previous command
If we want to see collection/list/array we need to write "$_" after |

For example:
Get-Module -ListAvailable | ? {$_.Version -ge "2.0.0.0"}

This command show us only these modules, which version is that same or newer from 2.0.0.0.

For today that's all, see you!!!
