Task from Powershell part 1

Mr. Tomasz said that we don't have too describe
all of tasks in Powershell so I choose a few to
describe.

BitsTransfer

BitsTransfer is module in powershell which is use to
managing background data transfers.

Commands:
1. Import-Module BitsTransfer - loading of bitstransfer module

2. Get-Command -Module BitsTransfer - listing of all commands in this module,

3. Start-BitsTransfer -Source http://szuflandia.pjwstk.edu.pl/pub/repo/java/lubuntu_13_04_v02.zip -Destination D:\ -Credential $cred -Authentication Negotiate

This command above is for downloading something from internet, in my case I download JPG file with
photo of man with snake in hands.

4. Get-BitsTransfer - we can see transfer status,

5. Complete-BitsTransfer -BitsJob $job - this command we have to use sometimes to end of downloading
when we see in transfer status "transfered".

Measure-Command - this command is use to timing.

Measure-Command {Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Windows}
We can see list of time units like days/hours/minutes/seconds etc.

Get-Alias | ? {$_.Definition -like "Get-ChildItem"}
We can see a list of shorcuts.

ls C:\ | %{Sleep -Milliseconds 250; return $_} | Format-Table
We can see a list of permissions, last write time and names.
