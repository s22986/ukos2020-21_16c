question mark means....

IF we want to get live ' ps ' we may use command ' top ' 
next questionas teached me gow to use command  'ps' , 'kill' 'killall' and what is PID, 
what is STDIN and STDOUT

skip (Ctrl-D) | quit (Ctrl-C)


if we started any programme from terminal ( etc gedit ) we can't use terminal soon. We can stop programme

by Ctrl+Z Keys but then programme isn't working. (stopped)

To back to program we need to get command fg %[x], where x is number of stopped programme 

^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 gedit
ubuntu@bss-ubu1804:~$ fg %1
gedit

When the process was stopped and we try to write something, we can't see any changes, 
but after command fg %1 (fg - forground) the changes are saved 



also we may used 
ubuntu@bss-ubu1804:~$ bg %1
[1]+ gedit &
then terminal and program works in the same time without blocking one of pid

When we want to start a program form terminal and both of windows can working, we need 
start a program with ' & ' on the end of name program
